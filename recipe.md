Unsalted butter – salted butter will work too just reduce salt to 1/8 tsp (and don’t forget to cover bowl when melting as salted butter splatters more).
Granulated sugar – for a little extra chewiness you could try it with half brown sugar.
Salt – table salt or sea salt work great. If using sea salt use a heaping 1/2 tsp because crystals are usually a little bigger.
Eggs – 3 is the perfect amount to help bind the brownies together.
Vanilla – I like to use a fair amount here for a boost of complimenting flavor.
Unbleached all-purpose flour – if bleached flour is what you have on hand it will work too, I’m trying to use unbleached flour more as it’s not chemically treated so it seems like a smarter option and it tastes better.
Unsweetened cocoa powder – standard unsweetened cocoa powder or dutch process cocoa both work great for this recipe.
Chocolate chips – you can use any intensity you prefer even bittersweet, my family likes milk chocolate chips and they offer that nice crackly top on the brownies with the extra sugar.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Prepare baking dish: spray and 8 by 8-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray, set aside.
Melt butter: place butter in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat in microwave until just melted.
Mix in sweetener and salt: Stir in sugar and salt, let cool slightly if warm.
Mix in wet ingredients: add in eggs and vanilla. Break yolks and stir with wooden spoon just until blended.
Mix in dry ingredients: add in flour, cocoa powder and chocolate chips. Fold and stir mixture with wooden spoon just until combined.
Add batter to pan: pour into prepared baking dish. Spread into an even layer. Bake in preheated oven just until barely set, about 40 – 46 minutes (toothpick may have a bit of sticky batter, careful not to over-bake).
Cool before cutting (if you can wait!): let cool completely on a wire rack then cut into individual squares. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
